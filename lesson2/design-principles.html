            <p>Website Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a></p>
            <p class="description">Description: <br><br>As I look at the YouTube mobile page, they have taken a lot of
                care to the proximity of their elements. Videos and their accompanying metadata are close to the video
                along with the additionaloptions for the video. Next the main navigation tabs are all closely situated
                near the bottom accessible to the user immediately. Finally, the company logo, search bar, and user
                account are located at the top making up the final grouping of items. </p>

            <p class="description">Description: <br><br>As I looked at the Rexburg homepage, I noticed that there were
                three distinct sections to the immediate page. Starting from the top, there is the Title with the menu
                button and search bar. Next there is a nice picture of the local area with a large link for those new to
                the area. Finally, we see that there is another group of often used links that are immediately available
                for users to choose from.</p>

            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <p>Company/Organization: Craigslist</p>
            <p>Website Link: <a href="https://eastidaho.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></p>
            <p class="description">Description: <br><br>Many of us have probably visited Craigslist at one point or
                another, but if not the homepage for a workstation is mainly just a bunch of lists separated into
                various categories for users to browse. Thankfully, when they made their mobile page, they compressed
                these lists into expandable sections underneath the main categories. This allowed them to clean up the
                mobile webpage and turn it into a simple list of categories that can be easily opened and closed at the
                user's desire. This process is a simple and repetitive process for users to easily get used to when they
                navigate the website. It also allows the repetition to continue underneath the initial categories and
                not overwhelm the user immediately.</p>
