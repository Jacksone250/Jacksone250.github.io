                <p>
                    My target Audience for Hot Cold Weather will be adults who like to spend time outside adventuring
                    and are
                    looking for the next place to backpack, white water raft, rock climb, or any of the other many
                    outdoor
                    activities. For example if a person was looking for a great area to camp in during the winter we
                    would
                    provide links and weather conditions in those areas for them to review.
